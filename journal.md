# Documentation
## Monday April 3rd

#### Getting Started
In this class, we joined forces with Ilya, and kicked off our brainstorming to figure out a final idea for our project. We all presented our own ideas and inspirations and started thinking of how to bring stuff together. 
Finally, we decided on creating a display of rotating wooden logs that switches with time showing different scenery from the day


#### Preliminary Sketching

We then started preliminary sketching and trying to figure out what kind of mechanisms our project would have.

#### Measurements!

We realized we needed wooden panels of specific side-length and overall length and that these dimensions would rely on the box dimensions and the amount of space we need to give our motors on the sides. So we grabbed a few tape measures and noted down all the dimensions needed -- the dimensions for our conveyer belt frame, the dimensions for our wooden panel, the overall box dimensions...etc. 

#### Frame and Wooden Panels
We then split forces, and Alpha and Ilya started brainstorming and working on the frame, and Debbie and Sarah started picking out suitable wooden panels. However, after digging through all the available wood, we realized we probably needed to make some pieces, and confirmed with eachother how these panels would look, and shared our request for wood with the professor. 
Finally, Alpha stayed overtime because he was feeling crafty today and finished putting together our frame!!

## Monday April 10th 

#### Tasklist 
We spent the first portion of class time brainstorming detailed task list items and posing tentative timings for when we should complete them. You can find more information about that [here](https://github.com/sarahalyahya/machineLab_PanelStory/blob/main/tasklist%26schedule.md). But overall, we divided our workflow into different categories and gave each category around a week for us to complete as we have 4 weeks left until the deadline
#### 3D Model
We also spend some time creating a 3D model of our imagined final structure to make sure all teammates have the same vision to work towards. Here's a screenshot of the model: <img width="440" alt="Screen Shot 2023-04-10 at 4 21 27 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57350290/230901297-a33f8dab-0768-4878-b0a5-bd7c5936060a.png">

#### Cutting Wood Panels
Then, we chop saw-ed some of the wooden panels that the professor prepared for us into 38cm panels.

#### Drilling Metal Hubs! 
After delibrating how to connect our stepper motors to the panels. The prof recommended we just directly connect the pieces as we have enough stepper motors to go around. We thought about how we would attach our proximity sensors and it seemed like it would be feasible. So we went ahead and drilled in 5mm metal hubs into our wooden panels.

#### Testing for dimensions
Finally, we tested our panels with taped stepper motors to make sure that they would have sufficient room to rotate fully ![IMG_5021](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57350290/230917293-f13573b5-8854-42aa-98a3-85937ed34eb7.jpg)

## April 24th Update 
After a week of intense capstone-ing, we used this weekend to catch up and make some significant progress! 

### Some Planning & Drilling
We continued to drill some metal hubs onto the other sides of our wooden panels, preparing them completely for usage.

### Re-thinking our frame
After finalizing our wooden panels, we went back to the frame we put together earlier, to take some more accurate measurements, and make changes on the frame according to our panels. We disassembled the frame after taking measurements, and put it back together based on the new information we now have, making it more fitting and more solid.

### How will we create rotational movement from both sides? 
After fixing our frame, we started looking for parts that will enable us to maintain the rotational movement created by the stepper motor. We realized that using the metal hubs that take in rod but allow rotation would be the ideal option in this case, so we grabbed a few and started planning how to install them on our frame. 

![rotational](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57350290/233958820-7b7d1624-786d-456f-a50d-bd0519a7af8e.jpg)

Afterward, we found the correct corresponding screws and installed them into our frame, and then started trying out different rods and brainstorming ways to make them fit into both the wooden panel. This is something we need a bit more guidance with. 

### What designs will we install on the panels?
One of the main questions we had in this process, was what designs we will install on the panel to make something beautiful that matches our theme? So we did some sketching and came up with a division of themes and combinations of different drawings that we will display on the panel. We decided that our 4 view categories will be (NYUAD, Desert, the Corniche, and a Seaview), and the divisions of our panels will be sky (panels 1-2), architecture (3-5), and then a ground / pedestrian panel.

## Thursday April 27th Update
### Scrapping the frame!
After realizing our frame is too crooked to be stable, and thinking of ways to connect the motor/panel/rods combination together. We realized that having two panels on either side of our cube, one aluminum for the motors, and one wooden for the other end of the metal rod would be stable and sufficient. 


### Mounting Motors
After that, we started experimenting with installing the stepper motors, especially after getting guidance from the professor regarding using an aluminum panel and mounting stepper motors. So, we mounted a couple of motors, and worked around the long metal rods to test the rotational movement

 ![340392090_230793426240371_4222511607543322215_n](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57350290/235360943-71d71e49-f543-4ec4-8c4a-d4920eda0d7a.jpg)

## Saturday April 29th Update 
 ### Cutting and installing metal rods
 
![340466155_1392148428210441_5313071037017674667_n](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57350290/235361050-b46c7cc1-2f5e-46ff-a527-b184c7e5f53b.jpg)

We measured the length needed for the metal rods in order to have our wooden panels centered in our cube, and got assistance from the professor in cutting and installing them on the panel. 

### Mounting the other side of the frame
We then mounted the wooden panel opposite to the motors, and added the rotating metal hubs on it with all the ready wooden panels. The rest of the wooden panels are yet to be added when the rest of the metal rods are cut. 
![343776144_242308488330330_5793310255412685537_n](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57350290/235361191-9194d3d6-edd2-4b8f-ba84-a29bc68f4270.jpg)

### Testing Stepper Motor Rotation
After that, we wanted to test the actual mechanism, and see if the panels will rotate successfully. 
Check out [this video](https://youtube.com/shorts/0FxYwWliF1A) to see what that looked like! 

### Connecting our Motors to H-Bridge and Power Supply
![340571142_1353862418677627_8924488667739704493_n](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57350290/235361568-3990e683-9260-411e-9946-38b33c16de05.jpg)
After that, we started on the electronics -- connecting our motors to the h-bridge and power supply. We are still a bit confused on how to use one power supply for all of our motors, and are waiting to seek advice on that. but generally, we started with connecting a couple of our motors and soldering the wires longer. 

### What's left?
Installing two more panels (waiting for connectors), connecting the rest of our motors, and testing our designs in order to synchronize the rotations. 

## May 1st Update
### Shaft Couplers 
We spent some time making our own 5-8mm shaft couplers since we ran out!

### Aligning and tightening metal rods
We also finished mounting aligning our metal rods preparing for the mounting of the sensors

### Soldering
Finally, we started soldering our Arduino!

## Weekend of May 5th Update

### Finalizing wire connections, soldering wires, wire hiding slider mechanism
We finalized all wire connnections, soldered wires longer and created a small compartment for the wires.

We mounted all of our sensors and starting figuring out the code to get the machine running!
