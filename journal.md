# Documentation
## Monday April 3rd

#### Getting Started
In this class, we joined forces with Ilya, and kicked off our brainstorming to figure out a final idea for our project. We all presented our own ideas and inspirations and started thinking of how to bring stuff together. 
Finally, we decided on creating a display of rotating wooden logs that switches with time showing different scenery from the day


#### Preliminary Sketching

We then started preliminary sketching and trying to figure out what kind of mechanisms our project would have.

#### Measurements!

We realized we needed wooden panels of specific side-length and overall length and that these dimensions would rely on the box dimensions and the amount of space we need to give our motors on the sides. So we grabbed a few tape measures and noted down all the dimensions needed -- the dimensions for our conveyer belt frame, the dimensions for our wooden panel, the overall box dimensions...etc. 

#### Frame and Wooden Panels
We then split forces, and Alpha and Ilya started brainstorming and working on the frame, and Debbie and Sarah started picking out suitable wooden panels. However, after digging through all the available wood, we realized we probably needed to make some pieces, and confirmed with eachother how these panels would look, and shared our request for wood with the professor. 
Finally, Alpha stayed overtime because he was feeling crafty today and finished putting together our frame!!

## Monday April 10th 

#### Tasklist 
We spent the first portion of class time brainstorming detailed task list items and posing tentative timings for when we should complete them. You can find more information about that [here](https://github.com/sarahalyahya/machineLab_PanelStory/blob/main/tasklist%26schedule.md). But overall, we divided our workflow into different categories and gave each category around a week for us to complete as we have 4 weeks left until the deadline
#### 3D Model
We also spend some time creating a 3D model of our imagined final structure to make sure all teammates have the same vision to work towards. Here's a screenshot of the model:
